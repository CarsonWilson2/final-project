    <h1>The Creator</h1>
    <h2> Carson Wilson the creator of Souly You is a young black male from Oakland California. I have always wanted to start my own clothing brand. I have loved and been infested into clothing for a very long time. I Have known I wanted to start a clothing brand for a while now. I have always dreamed of making stylish yet cozy clothes.  Comfortable clothes, but also a way for people to express themselves. I knew that if I were to make clothes I would want to make meaningful clothes. I would want to make clothes that mean something to each person who buys it.
